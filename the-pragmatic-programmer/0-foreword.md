# Foreword

- This is where pragmatism comes in. You shouldn’t be wedded to any
particular technology, but have a broad enough background and experience base to allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations. Your background stems from an understanding of the basic
principles of computer science, and your experience comes from a wide
range of practical projects. Theory and practice combine to make you
strong.

- Care about your craft: We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care
about doing it well.

- Think! About your Work: In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer, we’re challenging you to think
about what you’re doing while you’re doing it.

- Kaizen applies to individuals, too. Every day, work to refine
the skills you have and to add new tools to your repertoire. Unlike the
Eton lawns, you’ll start seeing results in a matter of days. Over the
years, you’ll be amazed at how your experience has blossomed and
your skills have grown.
