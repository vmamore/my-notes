# Objects and Data Structures
<!-- TOC -->

- Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without
changing the existing data structures. OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add
new classes without changing existing functions.

- Objects expose behavior and hide data. 

- Data structures expose data and have no significant behavior.
