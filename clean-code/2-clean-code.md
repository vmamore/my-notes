# Clean Code
<!-- TOC -->

- Despite this seeming juxtaposition of meaning, the words
carry a powerful message. Our code should be matter-of-fact as opposed to speculative.
It should contain only what is necessary. Our readers should perceive us to have been
decisive.

- Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. So if you want to go fast,
if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to
read.

- Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
