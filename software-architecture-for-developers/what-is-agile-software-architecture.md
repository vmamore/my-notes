# What is agile software architecture?
<!-- TOC -->

## Different software architectures provide differing levels of agility.

## How much agility to do you need?
- Understanding the speed at which your organisation or business changes is important because
it can help you decide upon the style of architecture to adopt; whether that’s a monolithic
architecture, a micro-services architecture or something in between. You need to understand
the trade-offs and make your choices accordingly. You don’t get agility for free.
