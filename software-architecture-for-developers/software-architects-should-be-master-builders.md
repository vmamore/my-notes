# Software Architects Should be Masters Builders?
<!-- TOC -->

- A mason would have an apprentice working for him. When the mason moved on
to a new job, the apprentice would move with him. When a mason felt that his
apprentice had learned enough about the trade, he would be examined at a Masonâ€™s
Lodge.
Again, it comes back to the strong apprenticeship model in place and this is exactly why coaching
and mentoring should be a part of the modern software architecture role. We need to grow the
software architects of tomorrow and every software development team needs their own master
builder.
