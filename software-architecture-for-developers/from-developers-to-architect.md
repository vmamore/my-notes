# From Developers to Architect
<!-- TOC -->

1. Architectural drivers: capturing and challenging a set of complex non-functional requirements versus simply assuming their existence.
2. Designing software: designing a software system from scratch versus extending an
existing one.
3. Technical risks: proving that your architecture will work versus hoping for the best.
4. Architecture evolution: being continually engaged and evolving your architecture versus
choosing to hand it off to an “implementation team”.
5. Coding: being involved in the hands-on elements of the delivery versus watching from
the sidelines.
6. Quality assurance: assuring quality and selecting standards versus being reviewed against
them or doing nothing
