# Should Software Architects Code?
<!-- TOC -->

-  In my ideal view of the world, software architects should
code. Somebody once told me that the key characteristic of a good architect is the ability to think
in an abstract way. You can also think of it as the ability to not get caught up in the details all of
the time. That’s fine, but those boxes and lines that you’re drawing do need to be coded at some
point.

- Appreciating that you’re going to be contributing to the coding activities often provides enough
incentive to ensure that your designs are grounded in reality. If they aren’t, you’ll soon experience
that pain once you understand the problems from a developer’s perspective.
