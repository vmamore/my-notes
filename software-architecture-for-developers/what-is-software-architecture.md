# What is software architecture?
<!-- TOC -->

## Application architecture
- The building blocks are predominantly software based and include things like programming
languages and constructs, libraries, frameworks, APIs, etc. It’s described in terms of classes,
components, modules, functions, design patterns, etc. Application architecture is predominantly
about software and the organisation of the code.

## System architecture
- Compared to application architecture, system architecture is described in terms of higher levels of abstraction; from
components and services through to sub-systems. Most definitions of system architecture include
references to software and hardware. After all, you can’t have a successful software system
without hardware, even if that hardware is virtualised somewhere out there on the cloud.

## Software architecture
- Software architecture is simply the
combination of application and system architecture. The big
picture is about having a holistic view across your software to ensure that your code is working
toward your overall vision rather than against it. 

### Examples:
- Cross-cutting concerns such as logging and exception handling.
- Security; including authentication, authorisation and confidentiality of sensitive data.
- Performance, scalability, availability and other quality attributes.
- Audit and other regulatory requirements.
- Real-world constraints of the environment.
- Interoperability/integration with other software systems.
- Operational, support and maintenance requirements.
- Consistency of structure and approach to solving problems/implementing features across
the codebase.
- Evaluating that the foundations you’re building will allow you to deliver what you set out to deliver.

## Enterprise architecture - strategy rather than code
- Enterprise architecture generally refers to the sort of work that happens centrally and across
an organisation. It looks at how to organise and utilise people, process and technology to make
an organisation work effectively and efficiently. In other words, it’s about how an enterprise
is broken up into groups/departments, how business processes are layered on top and how
technology underpins everything.
