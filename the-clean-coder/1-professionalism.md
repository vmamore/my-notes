# Professionalism
<!-- TOC -->

-  If a nonprofessional makes an error, the employer cleans up the mess. But when a
professional makes a mistake, he cleans up the mess.

- Professionalism is all about taking responsibility.

- We harm the function of our software when we create bugs. Therefore, in order
to be professional, we must not create bugs.

- Your career is your responsibility.

- Professionals spend time caring for their profession.

- Design patterns. You ought to be able to describe all 24 patterns in the GOF book
and have a working knowledge of many of the patterns in the POSA books.

- Design principles. You should know the SOLID principles and have a good
understanding of the component principles.

- Methods. You should understand XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall,
Structured Analysis, and Structured Design.

- Disciplines. You should practice TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured
Programming, Continuous Integration, and Pair Programming.

- Artifacts: You should know how to use: UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri
Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables.

- Professionals practice. True professionals work hard to keep their skills sharp
and ready. It is not enough to simply do your daily job and call that practice.
Doing your daily job is performance, not practice. Practice is when you
specifically exercise your skills outside of the performance of your job for the
sole purpose of refining and enhancing those skills.

- The second best way to learn is to collaborate with other people. Professional
software developers make a special effort to program together, practice together,
design and plan together.

- The best way to learn is to teach. Nothing will drive facts and values into your
head faster and harder than having to communicate them to people you are
responsible for. So the benefit of teaching is strongly in favor of the teacher.

- Your employer’s problems are your problems. You need to understand what
those problems are and work toward the best solutions. As you develop a system
you need to put yourself in your employer’s shoes and make sure that the
features you are developing are really going to address your employer’s needs.

-  It’s easy to fall into an us versus them attitude with your employer.
 Professionals avoid this at all costs.
