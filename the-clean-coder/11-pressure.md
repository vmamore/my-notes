# Pressure
<!-- TOC -->

- The professional developer is calm and decisive under pressure. As the pressure
grows he adheres to his training and disciplines, knowing that they are the best
way to meet the deadlines and commitments that are pressing on him.

- The best way to stay calm under pressure is to avoid the situations that cause
pressure. 

-  The business will always want these
commitments because they want to eliminate risk. What we must do is make
sure that the risk is quantified and presented to the business so that they can
manage it appropriately. Accepting unrealistic commitments thwarts this goal
and does a disservice to both the business and to ourselves.

- The difference is important. Professionals will always help the business find a
way to achieve its goals. But professionals do not necessarily accept commitments made for them by the business. In the end, if we can find no way to meet
the promises made by the business, then the people who made the promises
must accept the responsibility.

- Choose disciplines that you feel comfortable following in a crisis. Then follow
them all the time. Following these disciplines is the best way to avoid getting
into a crisis.
