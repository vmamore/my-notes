# Mentoring Apprenticeship Craftmanship 
<!-- TOC -->

- Craftsman: This word brings to mind skill
and quality. It evokes experience and competence. A craftsman is someone who
works quickly, but without rushing, who provides reasonable estimates and
meets commitments. A craftsman knows when to say no, but tries hard to say
yes. A craftsman is a professional.

- So you make the meme observable. You act as a role model. You become a craftsman first, and let your
craftsmanship show.
