- Being able to sense your errors is really important. Not just in typing, but in
everything. Having error-sense means that you very rapidly close the feedback
loop and learn from your errors all the more quickly. 

- Software development is a marathon, not a sprint. You canâ€™t win the race by
trying to run as fast as you can from the outset. You win by conserving your
resources and pacing yourself. 

- Instead, regularly measure your progress against your goal, and come up with three4
fact-based end dates: best case, nominal case, and worst case. Be as honest as
you can about all three dates. Do not incorporate hope into your estimates!
Present all three numbers to your team and stakeholders. Update these
numbers daily.
