# Saying Yes
<!-- TOC -->

-   Say. Mean. Do.
    There are three parts to making a commitment:
    1. You say you’ll do it.
    2. You mean it.
    3. You actually do it.

- The secret ingredient to recognizing real commitment is to look for sentences
that sound like this: I will . . . by . . . (example: I will finish this by Tuesday.)

- Professionals know their limits. They know how much overtime they can
effectively apply, and they know what the cost will be

- Professionals are not required to say yes to everything that is asked of them.
However, they should work hard to find creative ways to make “yes” possible.
When professionals say yes, they use the language of commitment so that there
is no doubt about what they’ve promised.
